# Findings
Men's street footwear is their top performing product and its followed by women's apparel. Adidas makes more in-store sales than online and outlets. Adidas recorded more sales in 2021 compared to 2020. In terms of region they have more customers in the west and northeast.

# RecommendationS
Adidas needs to consider creating more in-stores in Omaha, Baltimore, Chicago, Des Moines, Fargo and Minneapolis because these are the areas where they make the lowest sales in the United States.
